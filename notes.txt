random "onboard" is a keyword to call the onscreen keyboard in Ubuntu....who knew?! I named my app that and when I called it - a keyboard pops up

    - I added null='Default Subject', 
    to the model to solve.

This time when I encountered the same error as above I chose the python option 1 - provide default for exisiting records and entered 0 when prompted next. Migrations successful.

I had an error where django couldn't find my template and it was because I had my directory wrong (or my route didn't reflect my actual directory)
